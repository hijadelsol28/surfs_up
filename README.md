# Surfs_Up
## Overview
This project uses Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval to produce an analyis of temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii. Summary statistics of temperature data focusing on the months of June and December were used in order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business could operate year-round instead of seasonally.

## Summary

* The average temperature in June is higher than the average temperature in December. This difference is not too severe, given that the average temperature remains in the 70's.


## Results
The temperature results are relatively similar between June and December. The surf and ice cream shop would do well to open up year-round for business.
